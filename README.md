# Full-Duplex Microstrip Patch Antenna Development

This GitHub repository contains the project files and documentation for the development of a Full-Duplex Microstrip Patch Antenna system. This project was completed as part of the EE 493 Applied Electromagnetics Laboratory coursework.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project was to design and develop a closely spaced two-port microstrip patch antenna system with exceptional isolation enhancement (> 90 dB). The system was intended for use in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) applications as well as Full-Duplex transceiver systems, specifically operating at 28 GHz.

## Key Achievements

- Successfully designed and fabricated the Full-Duplex Microstrip Patch Antenna system.
- Utilized a combination of Defected Ground Structures (DGS), Near-Field Decoupling Structures (NFDS), and metallic vias to achieve remarkable isolation enhancement (> 90 dB).
- Maintained excellent impedance matching performance (< -15 dB) while reducing mutual coupling between ports to < -90 dB.
- Demonstrated a broadside gain of 7.11 dBi for individual antennas in the two-port MIMO system, along with a remarkable efficiency of 97%.
- Validated the proposed concept through comprehensive full-wave simulations in Ansys HFSS and experimental measurements on a fabricated prototype.
- Analyzed critical MIMO performance metrics, including Total Active Reflection Coefficient (TARC), Envelop Correlation Coefficient (ECC), and Channel Capacity Loss (CCL).
